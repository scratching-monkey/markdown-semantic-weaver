# Markdown Semantic Weaver - Test Workspace

This workspace contains sample markdown files for testing the Markdown Semantic Weaver VS Code extension.

## Files

- `sample-source-1.md` - Introduction to Machine Learning
- `sample-source-2.md` - Deep Learning Fundamentals
- `sample-source-3.md` - AI Ethics and Responsible Development

## How to Test the Extension

1. **Add Source Files**: Use the "Markdown Semantic Weaver: Add Source" command to add these markdown files to your weaving session.

2. **Explore Similarities**: The extension will automatically detect similarities between sections across the documents.

3. **Create Destination Documents**: Use "Markdown Semantic Weaver: Add New Destination Document" to create a new document for weaving content.

4. **Weave Content**: Use the Sections View to see detected sections and insert them into your destination document.

5. **Advanced Features**:
   - Open Comparison Editor to see similar sections side-by-side
   - Use the Glossary Editor to manage terms
   - Try the Block Editor for focused content editing

## Testing Scenarios

- **Similarity Detection**: The first two files discuss AI/ML topics and should show similarities
- **Content Weaving**: Create a comprehensive AI guide by combining sections from all files
- **Term Management**: The glossary should extract technical terms from the content
- **Document Publishing**: Test the publish feature to generate final output

## Tips

- Start with small files to understand the workflow
- Use the extension's tree views in the sidebar to navigate content
- Try the different editing modes (Block Editor, Comparison Editor)
- Experiment with the AI-powered merge feature (if enabled)

Happy weaving! ðŸŽ¯
