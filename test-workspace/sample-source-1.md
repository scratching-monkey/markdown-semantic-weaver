# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This revolutionary technology has transformed industries ranging from healthcare to finance.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning algorithms build mathematical models based on training data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. The algorithms learn patterns from data and use these patterns to make decisions.

### Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled training data to learn a mapping function
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns through interaction with an environment

## Applications in Modern Technology

Machine learning powers many applications we use daily:

- Recommendation systems on streaming platforms
- Fraud detection in financial transactions
- Image recognition in social media
- Natural language processing in virtual assistants
- Autonomous vehicles and robotics

The future of machine learning continues to evolve with advances in deep learning and neural networks.
