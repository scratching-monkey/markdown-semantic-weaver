# Foundational Hockey Knowledge Ontology

This document describes the foundational concepts of ice hockey, organized by distinct domains.

## The Three Domains

The three identified domains for hockey are:

- **Gameplay:** The rules, strategies, and actions that occur during a game.
- **Personnel:** The roles and responsibilities of players, coaches, and staff.
- **Equipment:** The gear and tools used to play the game.

### 2. Gameplay Domain

#### 2.1 Core Concepts

Gameplay is organized by a hierarchy of concepts:

**Periods** form the basic time structure of a game. A regulation game has three periods.

**Plays** are the specific actions teams take to advance the puck and score.

- **Offensive Plays:** Strategies used in the opponent's zone (e.g., Cycle, Overload).
- **Defensive Plays:** Strategies used in the team's own zone (e.g., Box, Diamond).

**Rules** are the regulations that govern play.

- **Icing:** An infraction that occurs when a player shoots the puck from their side of the center red line across the opposing goal line.
- **Offside:** An infraction that occurs when a player on the attacking team enters the offensive zone before the puck.

### 3. Personnel Domain

The Personnel domain represents the different roles within a hockey organization.

**Coaches** are responsible for team strategy and player development.

- **Head Coach:** The primary coach.
- **Assistant Coach:** Supports the head coach.

**Management** is responsible for the overall direction of the team.

- **General Manager:** Makes player personnel decisions.
