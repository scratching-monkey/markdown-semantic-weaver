/**
 * Markdown Semantic Weaver - Robust Golden Path E2E Test Suite
 *
 * This test suite validates the complete user workflow using comprehensive test fixtures
 * from the hockey domain. It employs robust waiting mechanisms and specific assertions
 * to ensure reliable validation of semantic weaving functionality.
 *
 * Test Fixtures Used:
 * - hockey-ontology.md: Foundational hockey concepts with 20+ glossary terms
 * - offensive-strategy-framework.md: Strategy document with formations and plays
 * - official-rink-and-equipment-spec.md: Technical specifications with equipment details
 *
 * Key Improvements:
 * - Event-driven waiting instead of fixed timeouts
 * - Specific assertions based on fixture content
 * - Deterministic behavior with predictable test data
 * - Comprehensive validation of similarity detection across multiple files
